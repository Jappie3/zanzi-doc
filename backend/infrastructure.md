# Backend infrastructure
![FLWSB-Backend.png](https://github.com/Jappie3/zanzi-doc/blob/backend-general/backend/assets/FLWSB-Backend.png)
- The backend for the FLWSB project consists of the following applications:
	- Influxdb: open source time series database
		- Used to store data gathered by the sensors & weather station
	- Mosquitto: open source server implementation of the MQTT protocol
		- Receives messages from the gateway
		- MQTT server for weather station data (weather station doesn't work with LoRaWAN)
	- NodeRuby: custom API written in JavaScript
		- Contains a form used to register new devices
		- Contains query-builder that can be used in future iterations
	- SensorMeasurements: JavaScript application for the sensor
		- Listens to the MQTT server for the sensors and formats the data
		- Sends the formatted data to the database
	- MetadataMeasurements: JavaScript application for the gateway
		- Subscribes to the MQTT channel where the gateway sends it metadata
		- Sends that metadata to the database for monitoring
	- WeatherStationMeasurements: JavaScript application for the weather station
		- Subscribes to the MQTT channel where the weather station sends its measurements
		- Sends the data to the database.
	- Nginx: acts as a reverse proxy for the website and the API
	- Grafana: open source web application for analytics and interactive visualization
		- Visualize weather data on a website
