# Project Documentation
This is the documentation for the work we carried out for in Zanzibar, building upon the progress made by the previous year's students. The project primarily focused on the development of the weather stations, including the associated gateway, as well as the complete remade of the backend system with the frontend.
## Project Overview
The objective of the project was to improve on what the students made last year and collect the weather data in Zanzibar. This is a simple representation of how it works.
