# Index of project documentation

This is the documentation for the work we carried out in Zanzibar, building upon the project made by the previous year's students. We primarily focused on the development of the weather stations & sensorboards, as well as the associated gateway. Besides that, we complete rewrote the back- & frontend.

## Project Overview

The objective of the project was to improve on what the students made last year and collect weather data in Zanzibar. This is a simple representation of how it works:
