# LoRaWAN

## Alterations in the existing SAMDaaNo21 library

Some alterations to the existing SAMDaaNo library where necessary. On the first version of the SAMDaaNo21 the LoRa-module was incorrectly connected to the MCU but was usable with a work around. In the new version we wired the module correctly but had to change the library to undo the work-around.
