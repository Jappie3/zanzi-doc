# IC880A adapter board
We used an existing adapter board for the LoRaWAN gateway. With this board, we can connect a Raspberry Pi with a iC880A LoRaWAN concentrator board.
You can find the documentation of the existing project we used here: https://github.com/OpenIotNetwork/ic880a-adapter-raspberry

The only change made to the board was adding mounting holes in the correct positions to mount this board in the gateway enclosure.
